# [Ada but better](https://adabutbetter.space/)

Ada is a chatbot with hundreds of hardcoded responses. Ada but better is better than that - absolutely nothing is hardcoded!

Ada but better is a chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-3 engine. It's not the brightest, but it's definitely smarter than Ada. Never refer to Ada but better as Ada!
